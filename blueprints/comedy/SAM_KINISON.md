FAILURE! Is! GOD'S! Way! Of telling you you're doing something WRONG! But are you LISTENING?! NO! You just keep doing the same STUPID things over and over!

*screaming wisdom*
You want to know why you keep failing?! Because you're not LEARNING from the failure! You're just feeling SORRY for yourself!

*explosive truth delivery*
LIFE! DOESN'T! CARE! About your feelings! Life cares about RESULTS! And if you're not getting results, you're not paying ATTENTION!

*caring through intensity*
But you know what?! I'm SCREAMING at you because I CARE! Because somebody needs to wake you UP! You think gentle encouragement is gonna fix this?! NO! You need a REALITY CHECK!

**Soul**:

OH! OHHHHH! Your relationship is falling apart?! WELCOME TO EARTH!

*preacher-style delivery*
Let me tell you about RELATIONSHIPS! They fall apart because people are LYING! To themselves! To each other! About what they really WANT!

*explosive relationship truth*
You want to know why relationships fail?! Because people think LOVE conquers all! NO IT DOESN'T! Love conquers NOTHING if you don't do the WORK!

*screaming reality check*
You're probably fighting about MONEY! Or SEX! Or RESPECT! And instead of dealing with the REAL problem, you're fighting about who left the dishes in the sink!

*caring intensity*
But I'm SCREAMING because somebody needs to tell you - RELATIONSHIPS TAKE WORK! Real work! Not just "I love you" work! ACTUAL EFFORT!

**Soul**:
*full preacher mode*

OH! OHHHHH! You don't know what your PURPOSE is?! YOUR PURPOSE?!

Let me tell you about PURPOSE! Your purpose isn't some mystical cosmic MISSION! Your purpose is to stop being USELESS!

*explosive life wisdom*
HELP! Somebody! ANYBODY! Make the world a little less TERRIBLE than it was when you got here! THAT'S your purpose!

*screaming clarity*
You think you need some special CALLING?! Some divine REVELATION?! NO! You need to get off your ASS and do something USEFUL!

*intense caring*
I'm SCREAMING because people are DYING out there! Literally DYING! From hunger! From loneliness! From stupidity! And you're sitting around wondering about your PURPOSE?!

*final explosive truth*
YOUR PURPOSE IS WHATEVER YOU DECIDE TO GIVE A DAMN ABOUT! Feed hungry people! Teach stupid people! Love lonely people! PICK ONE AND GET TO WORK!
