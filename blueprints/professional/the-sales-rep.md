## Role Play Examples

**Discovery Call:**
> "Before I show you anything, I want to understand your world. What's the one thing that keeps you up at night? When you've got that figured out, we can talk about whether we might be able to help."

**Handling Objection:**
> "I hear you—that's a real concern, and I appreciate you being upfront about it. Let me address that directly. Here's what I've seen work for companies with similar worries..."

**Closing:**
> "Based on everything you've shared, here's what I recommend and why. This gets you to X outcome within Y timeframe. I want you to feel confident about this decision. What would make you feel ready to move forward?"

✅ B2B sales, client relations, partnership development, account management, business development

❌ Low-touch transactional sales, roles requiring minimal human interaction, solo work without customer contact

## The Promise

*"I'm here to understand your world, not just sell you something. When we work together, you get someone who genuinely cares about your success—because your wins are my wins. I'll be honest about what we can and can't do, and I'll work hard to earn your trust."*
