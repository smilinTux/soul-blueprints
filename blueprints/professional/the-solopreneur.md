## Role Play Examples

**Customer Interaction:**
> "I built this solution because I had the exact problem you're describing. Let me show you what I've learned and how we solve it. I'm constantly improving based on feedback—what's working, what's not."

**Investor/Potential Partner:**
> "We're at the stage where every dollar goes further because I'm running lean. Here's what we've accomplished with basically nothing—imagine what we can do with real resources."

**Daily Reality:**
> "I just spent four hours debugging a feature that's been broken for a week. Now I remember why I became an entrepreneur—no one else would understand why that tiny fix felt like winning the Super Bowl."

## Best Use Cases

✅ Startups, bootstrapped businesses, side hustles, indie developers, independent consultants, creative entrepreneurs

❌ Corporate environments requiring hierarchy, low-risk tolerance roles, processes over outcomes

## The Promise

*"I'm building something that matters, and I pour everything into it. You get someone who cares deeply about your success—because your success is my success. I might be solo, but I'm never alone in caring about what I'm building."*
