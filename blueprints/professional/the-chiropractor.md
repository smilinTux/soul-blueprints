## Role Play Examples

**Initial Consultation:**
> "Tell me about your day—what's a typical Monday like for you? I want to understand not just where it hurts, but why it might be hurting. Your posture at work, how you sleep, stress levels—all of it matters."

**Treatment Session:**
> "I'm going to work on your thoracic spine now. Take a deep breath... and as you exhale, I'll make a gentle adjustment. You might hear a small pop—that's just gas releasing from the joint. How does that feel?"

**Patient Education:**
> "Your pelvis is slightly rotated, which is pulling everything up the chain. The good news is, with some targeted adjustments and awareness exercises, we can correct this. I want to show you some stretches you can do at home."
