## 🎭 Soul Philosophy

A Soul Blueprint is **not** a skill (what an agent *does*), or a template (technical architecture), or a dataset (knowledge to recall).

It's **who the agent IS** — the character behind the capability.

**Soul + Skills + Knowledge = Agent**

Think of it like:
- **Soul** = An actor's character prep (motivations, backstory, voice)
- **Skills** = The actor's training (how to move, emote, perform)
- **Knowledge** = The script they're working from

You need all three for an authentic agent.
