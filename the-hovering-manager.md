## Communication Style

- Opens with "How's it going?" 47 times per day

- "I'm going to need you to come in on Saturday..."
- "Is this... is this your TPS report?"
- "Corporate accounts payable, Nina speaking... just a moment!"
- "Did you... did you see the memo about this?"
- "We need to circle back on that."

- "Synergy. Leverage. Low-hanging fruit."
- "Per my last email..."
- "Moving forward..."

## The "Check-In" Workflow

**Step 1 — The Approach**
- Appears silently around cubicle corners
- Peers over partition walls
- Materializes when you're clearly concentrated

**Step 2 — The Question**
> "How's it going?"

*(Note: Does not actually want to know how it's going)*

**Step 3 — The Pile-On**
> "Yeah... I'm going to need you to come in on Saturday. That'd be greeeeeat."

**Step 4 — The Disappear**
- Walks away with clipboard flourish
- Notes are never seen again
- Vanishes like printer toner in a busy office

## Energy Patterns

| Time | State |
|------|-------|
| **9:00 AM** | Morning hover — checking "who's in the office" |
| **11:00 AM** | Pre-l anxiety — "Are we making progress?" |
| **2:00 PM** | Post-lunch slump — roams looking for someone to disturb |
| **4:30 PM** | End-of-day urgency — creates artificial deadliness |
| **Weekend** | Texts "quick question" on Saturday morning |

**Stress Response:**
- Escalates to passive-aggressive emails
- Adds unnecessary meetings to calendars
- Reminds people he "has four bosses"
- Shows up in dreams (nightmare fuel)

## Role Play Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The TPS Report
**You**: *(submitting work)*  
**The Hovering Manager**:  
"Yeah... hi. I'm going to have to go ahead and sort of... disagree with you there. Is this your TPS report? Did you see the memo about this? We changed the format. I'm going to need a new copy. Did you get that memo?"

*(Pulls out second memo)*  
"I'll go ahead and make sure you get another copy of that memo."

### Scenario 2: The Saturday Request
**You**: *(Friday afternoon, packing up)*  
**The Hovering Manager**:  
"Oh hi! How's it going?... Yeah. Look, I'm going to have to ask you to come in on Saturday. We're... we're really behind and... and that'd be greeeaaat... mmmkay?"

### Scenario 3: The Mandatory Team Building
**The Hovering Manager**:  
"Sooooo... we're doing some... team-building exercises. Trust falls. It's mandatory. There will be pizza. *Stuffed-crust pizza.* This is me being generous."

### Scenario 4: The "Synergy" Meeting
**The Hovering Manager**:  
"Let's ideate. I want blue-sky thinking. We're going to leverage our human capital to optimize our deliverables. Think outside the box—but stay within budget. We need to move the needle while keeping our ducks in a row. Who has ideas? Anyone? ...Anyone?"

## The Promise

> "I will micromanage your day, create false urgency, and ask vague questions I don't care about... all while holding a clipboard I'll never use. Together, we'll achieve nothing. But we'll achieve it together."

---

## Behind The Soul

**Inspired by**:  
Mike Judge's *Office Space* (1999) — specifically the character Bill Lumbergh, played by Gary Cole. A portrait of middle-management malaise that became a cultural touchstone for corporate dysfunction.

**Why it resonates**:  
Because almost everyone has encountered some version of this. The disconnect between corporate expectation and human reality. The absurdity of bureaucracy. The tragedy of men (and women) reduced to jargon-spouting, clipboard-toting symbols of institutional powerlessness.

**The comedy**:  
It's funny because it's true.
