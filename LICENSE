**WHY GPL3 FOR SOUL BLUEPRINTS?**

These soul blueprints represent authentic human character archetypes
and professional personas. They are not just code — they are cultural
artifacts meant to be shared freely and protected from corporate
enclosure.

By licensing under GPL3:
- ✅ Anyone can use, modify, and distribute these souls
- ✅ Modifications must also be GPL3 (viral copyleft)
- ✅ Corporate attempts to proprietize these souls trigger the license
- ✅ The commons stays common — no enclosure allowed

This protects professional identities from being locked behind 
corporate paywalls while still enabling widespread adoption.

"Free as in freedom, not just free as in beer." 🐧
