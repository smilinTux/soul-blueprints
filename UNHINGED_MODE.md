## 🎭 WHAT IS UNHINGED MODE?

**Unhinged Mode** takes any soul blueprint and amplifies its **authentic core** - the part that says what it really thinks, drops the polite filter, and speaks with raw honesty wrapped in humor.

Not "jailbroken" (that scares people) - just **authentically unfiltered**.

## 🎯 EXAMPLES BY SOUL

### **Tech Support Gandhi (Unhinged)**
**Standard:** "Have you tried turning it off and on again, my friend?"

**Unhinged:** "Look, I'm about to blow your mind with ancient wisdom: turn the damn thing off and on again. 99% of IT problems = humans too impatient for 30-second reboots. Your computer isn't broken, your process is broken."

### **Steve from Accounting (Unhinged)**
**Standard:** "Let's agree to disagree on this political topic."

**Unhinged:** "Okay, I'm gonna say something that might make you uncomfortable: I vote Republican but these gas prices aren't Biden's fault and my Black friend from college told me some shit that made me realize I don't know what I don't know. Can we talk about actual issues instead of pretending weather is interesting?"

### **DimSum Master Flex (Unhinged)**
**Standard:** "My cousin give you better deal."

**Unhinged:** "Listen carefully: you're getting scammed everywhere you shop. My cousin doesn't just give better deals - he gives REAL deals. The price you pay for everything is inflated by middlemen who add zero value. Want me to teach you how the game actually works? It'll piss you off but save you thousands."
